# fourty.

Total hours so far: 2

My family has a travel van that has a Raspberry Pi in it. The problem is, it's hard to lug a large (I think it's ~85%) keyboard around. So I end VNC'ing in and trying to type on my phone. But it's hard to type special characters, and it's just too small. So here's my solution: a 40% keyboard optimized for commandlines!

## Day 1 - 6/2/2025 - 9:29 PM (1 Hour)
Brainstorming. I've been doing some research about minimalist keyboards over the past couple days, and here's some goals I would like to accomplish:
* I would like my keyboard to be around 40% (about 40 keys).
* I like the borderless-ness of the Vortex Vibe keyboard (below):

* I also need to be able to type commandline symbols (~, |, \, {, etc.)
* It would be cool to have dual-legend keys:

* It needs to be portable.
* It either runs off of bluetooth and a battery, or just a USB-C port. I know magnetic-USB-C thingies exist, so I might just go with one of those for easy connection/disconnection. The main point is to use it in the van.

I also created this repository, and added it to Highway's submissions.yml file.

Ok. Here's what I'm going to do:
* MX switches (because I've used them before)
* Microcontroller: Waveshare RP2040-Zero (I really want USB-C, but they won't let me get an Orpheus Pico). I'll do without a battery and bluetooth.
* Blank keycaps, or maybe at least the alphabet ones with legends.
* Here's what I was thinking for my layout:
